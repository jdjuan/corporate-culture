# 2. Diagnosing the Culture

> There is always a culture
> There's no right or wrong culture. It is a matter of how we want to move towards the purpose defined
> There should not be a difference between the clients' and employees' perception of a company

Much like defining a new strategy, creating a new culture should begin with an analysis of the current one, using a framework that can be openly discussed throughout the organization. Leaders must understand what outcomes the current culture produces and how it does or doesn't align with current and anticipated market and business conditions.

> For example, if the companyâ€™s primary culture styles are results and authority but it exists in a rapidly changing industry, shifting toward learning or enjoyment (while maintaining a focus on results) may be appropriate.

### 1.1 Steps

1. **Identify Key Employees:** Those who had positive disruptive ideas and working styles
   1. Find people that can emotionally attach to the new culture, and that will help spread it
2. **Run Diagnosis:** Ask powerful questions to shed light. See below
3. **Define Change Managers:** There must be people responsible for:
   - Measuring: You need to evaluate performance on culture to make sure it becomes a daily habit!
   - Aiming at quick wins
   - Looking at the whole picture: Who will this hurt
   - Making things tangible
   - Putting facts on the table
   - Surfacing conflicts and talking about them. For example: "When incentives, behaviors, and actions are in conflict"
   - Get people to talk about their concerns
   - Involving leaders to participate in culture's problem solving
   - Iterating constantly and learning through the process
