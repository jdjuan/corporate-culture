# Corporate Culture

## 1. Problem

- The culture we have today is not enough to achieve our strategy

### 1.1 Golden Circle

Corporate Culture and the Golden Circle:

- **WHY:** Purpose/Mission
- **HOW:** Culture
- **WHAT:** Strategy

### 1.2 Strategy and Culture

- A company culture can't exist if the company goes out of business.
- So good strategy is clearly important. But if culture becomes a powerful enough influence on the motivations of the workforce, the culture can actually negatively impact an organization to the point of jeopardizing its solvency and its future.
- It's about discovering the organizational landscape: figuring out first if the existing culture in our business is going to readily enable our strategy or not.

> Find what actually drives behaviors that lead to decisions and actions that gets you to your strategy.

## 2. What is Corporate Culture?

Set of values and beliefs that define what is encouraged, discouraged, accepted, or rejected within an organization.

### 2.1 Characteristics of a Corporate Culture

- **[Unwritten](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*8wzyfCFGwltVSl_wMSy-qw.png):** It is present implictly in everyone's behavior
- **Enduring:** It lasts over time
- **Reinforced:** It makes sure more of the same joins the company, and less of that leave it
- **Unsupervised:** It is what is left when the leaders are not in the room
- **Pervasive:** It is followed by everyone despite role or position

### 2.2 What is composed of?

- Values
- Beliefs
- Behaviors (Practices)
  - Incentived through rewards
  - Corrected through discipline

> Also (Vision, Assumptions, People, Place)

## 3. Culture Consistency (Strong vs Weak)

> "There's no such thing as a good or bad culture, it's either a strong or weak culture. And a good culture for somebody else may not be a good culture for you." – Brian Chesky

A well-defined culture is important because:

- It gives the team some first principles to fall back on
- It aligns people on values that matter to the company
- It provides stability for the company
- It provides trust that bind people together
- It gives you a list of what to do and what not to do (exclusion)
- It allows you to retain the right employees. If you have strong core values, you'll know who you do and do not want to retain.

Each person plays his or her part in determining what the culture of the business will be. **If they don't know what the company stands for**, how they need to behave and where they fit in, **then they will make it up for themselves**.

> Somebody asked me: "What's the job of a CEO?", and there's a number of things a CEO does. What you mostly do is articulate the vision, develop the strategy, and you gotta hire people to fit the culture. If you do those three things, you basically have a company. And that company will hopefully be successful, if you have the right vision, the right strategy, and good people." – Brian Chesky

### 3.1 Three types of people

- **Culture-neutral:** Apathetic
- **Culture-negative:** Toxic
- **Culture-positive** Culture-positive people are the ones who will help improve your business and drive home what you want to achieve

### 3.2 Unaligned Leaders

Incumbent leaders who are unsupportive of desired change can be engaged and re-energized through training and education about the important relationship between culture and strategic direction. Often they will support the change after they understand its relevance, its anticipated benefits, and the impact that they personally can have on moving the organization toward the aspiration. However, culture change can and does lead to turnover: Some people move on because they feel they are no longer a good fit for the organization, and others are asked to leave if they jeopardize needed evolution.

### 3.3 Recruitment

> Our own data from executive recruiting activities shows that a lack of cultural fit is responsible for up to 68% of new-hire failures at the senior leadership level.

For individual leaders, cultural fit is as important as capabilities and experience

## 4. Culture Types

- **Macrocultures:** What distinguishes one industry from another.
- **Organization Cultures:** What differentiates two organizations in the same industry
- **Subcultures:** What distinguishes HR from Operations
- **Microcultures (tribes):** What distinguishes one team from another

### 4.1 Tribes

- The experience of culture is probably more a factor of intra and inter tribal dynamics, than any organisational one. [Read more here](https://julianstodd.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/organisational-culture/)
- Proposing a new method of doing work directly effects the employees at the front-line (operators). Because of this, new methodologies should consider the subcultures that already exist as they are being introduced.
