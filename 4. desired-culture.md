# Strong Culture

## Values

The originality of those values is less important than their authenticity.

> Don't be vague with your core values. Honesty, integrity, teamwork, and service are great, but if you don't understand why those are your core values, you haven't thought through it well enough.

## Recruitment

It is not about hiring someone for the next 3 or 4 features. It is much more than that. It is hiring their network and your next 10 employees. You want diversity in background, experience etc., but you want homogeneity of beliefs! You want people that are here to champion the mission — which should be the only thing that never changes.

> It is very interesting to see interviews focusing on testing skills through technical questions instead of testing culture fit.
> The best firms are "fanatical about recruiting new employees who are not just the most talented but also the best suited to a particular corporate culture." Ellis highlights that those firms often have 8-20 people interview each candidate.
> One study found applicants who were a cultural fit would accept a 7% lower salary, and departments with cultural alignment had 30% less turnover.
> Chesky tells us that he viewed bringing this first employee as analogous to bringing in new DNA into the company. He didn't view it as the person to build a few features. He viewed it much more long term, because there were going to be a thousand people just like him. You want diversity, of course, but you won't want diversity of values.
