# Changing Culture

- Start with the tribes
- In our company the tribes we have are the teams we have.

> Culture does not change because we desire to change it. Culture changes when the organization is transformed; the culture reflects the realities of people working together every day.

Instead of talking about changing the whole culture, it is much better to concentrate in changing the behaviors. Because they are more tangible

One reason these efforts are disappointing is that companies are trying to transform a whole lot of cultural dynamics all at once. We’ve found that managers get better results when they start with a few smaller successes, which then provide a basis for expanding. Start with one problem — or a few. Get some people to plan a couple of modest experiments to make progress on that issue, with guidance on the kinds of innovation you’d like to see. Build in some learning on the cultural issues that need to change. Try it out. Pay careful attention to what works and how. Incorporate the successful ideas into subsequent steps.

Public Service of New Hampshire, the state’s electric utility, provides an example: the company’s managers were focused almost exclusively on immediate issues (vs. strategic ones) and on their own jobs (rather than co-functional collaboration). Since the company was facing some major strategic decisions changing this culture was urgent. Instead of big, complex planning steps they began by working on two important performance challenges.

Major culture change happened in the course of the incremental pursuit of better operations — with no proclamations, mission statements, or debates about "what we mean by culture change." Senior management does have to provide some overall guidance in order to knit together the individual strands of progress, but the energy, the momentum, and the experimental ingenuity occur in the individual thrusts.
